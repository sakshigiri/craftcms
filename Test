Subject: Assistance Required: 504 Gateway Timeout on Admin Console Post-Migration to AWS ECS Fargate

Dear Craft CMS Support Team,

I hope you are doing well.

We are in the process of migrating our website, intact.ca, to an AWS-based architecture. The application is set to run on AWS ECS Fargate, and we are encountering an issue specifically with the admin console. Below are the details of the problem:

1. We have successfully created a Docker image for the website and its admin console.


2. When running the image locally, both the website and the admin console function as expected.


3. After pushing the same image to AWS ECR and running it in ECS Fargate, we experience the following issue:

The public-facing website works without any problems.

However, attempting to access the admin console (website.com/CMS/login) results in a 504 Gateway Timeout error.

Our CP_TRIGGER environment variable is set to CMS.



4. Upon investigation with AWS Support, we identified that the error originates from the application side, specifically due to an upstream timeout in PHP-FPM.


5. Interestingly, when making the same request using a host header that specifies the CloudFront-attached DNS, the request returns a 200 response instead of a timeout.



At this point, we suspect that there might be some configuration or networking behavior within Craft CMS that is affecting how the admin console responds when deployed on ECS Fargate.

Could you please provide any insights or guidance on this issue? Are there any known configurations or settings that might be causing this behavior in an AWS-hosted environment?

Looking forward to your assistance.
